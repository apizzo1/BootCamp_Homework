# Excel Challenge

This challenge was to analyze previous Kickstarter campaigns to discover possible trends regarding which types of campaigns are successful.

## About the Excel File

* The excel file included contains over 4000 Kickstarter trends with conditional formatting depending on the outcome of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live).
    * This was also shown using a pivot table to oragnize the campaigns by category. In addition, a stacked column pivot chart can be seen, allowing the user to filter by country
    * The same activity was done for organizing the campaigns by sub-category (pivot table and stacked column pivot chart)
* A column was added for Percent Funded, which used a formula to calculate how much of the campaign was funded. This column was then formatted to show Red for 0% Funded, transitioning to green if 100% Funded, and switching to Blue at the 200% Funded mark.
* Another pivot chart was added to compare the state of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live) against time (to deduce if a particular month of the year shows any specific trends).
    * A pivot line chart was used to visualize this data
* A line chart was also created that gives insight into a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.
    
## About the Data Analysis

A Word file was uploaded containing some insights into the data including:
* some conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns
* some limitations of the dataset
* some other possible tables/graphs that would be useful to understand this data

## Additional Analyses

* A summary statistics table was created, evaluating the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation of backers. Box plots were also created to visualize the data.
* An analysis of why the median better summarizes the data is included in the Word document, as well as a discussion of which type of campaign has more variability and why.
