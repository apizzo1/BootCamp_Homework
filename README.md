# Excel Challenge

This challenge was to analyze previous Kickstarter campaigns to discover possible trends regarding which types of campaigns are successful.

## About the Excel File

* The excel file included contains over 4000 Kickstarter trends with conditional formatting depending on the outcome of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live).
    * This was also shown using a pivot table to oragnize the campaigns by category. In addition, a stacked column pivot chart can be seen, allowing the user to filter by country
    * The same activity was done for organizing the campaigns by sub-category (pivot table and stacked column pivot chart)
* A column was added for Percent Funded, which used a formula to calculate how much of the campaign was funded. This column was then formatted to show Red for 0% Funded, transitioning to green if 100% Funded, and switching to Blue at the 200% Funded mark.
* Another pivot chart was added to compare the state of the campaign (successful, failed, canceled, or live) against time (to deduce if a particular month of the year shows any specific trends).
    * A pivot line chart was used to visualize this data
    
## About the Data Analysis

A Word file was uploaded containing some insights into the data including:
* some conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns
* some limitations of the dataset
* some other possible tables/graphs that would be useful to understand this data
